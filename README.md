# ðŸ¥ƒ Whiskey & `/regex/`

The main objective of this project is to help you understand regular expressions in a relaxed way, with clear examples and practical approaches, accompanied by a shot of whiskey or similar, but you can follow with gin and tonic as well.

### Dot `.`

The dot is a wildcard character that matches anything, including itself.

```js
/whisk.y/
```

With its traditional combination of rye [whiskey](#dot), sweet vermouth, and bitters, the Manhattan is an icon in the [whiskey](#dot) world. It is to [whiskey](#dot) what the martini is to gin and the base for countless cocktails. You can make it with bourbon, Canadian whisky, or any other style, and it's a splendid recipe to use when trying out any new-to-you brand of [whiskey](#dot).

#### Time to relax

```js
/9.m/
```

[9pm](#time-to-relax) is a good time to drink whiskey, but it's not a good time to drink coffee, in which case [9am](#time-to-relax) would be a more appropriate time. [9pm](#time-to-relax) can also be a good time for a cup of tea if you've already exceeded your daily whiskey quota.

#### Time to walk

```js
/ca./
```

It is not recommended to drive a [car](#time-to-walk) if you drink a shot of whiskey, or any other alcoholic beverage. Maybe it's better to enjoy your [cat](#time-to-walk)'s company or prepare a new shot.

### List `[]`


The [] construct in a regex is essentially shorthand for an | on all of the contents. For example [abc] matches a, b or c. 

```js
/[whisky]/
```

#### Time to groove

```js
/[jazz]/
```

Most of the time a good whiskey goes down very well accompanied by good music.
